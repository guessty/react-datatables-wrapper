# react-datatables-wrapper
A react wrapper around the DataTables plugin for jQuery. The package exposes the datatables api as well as adding/improving some properties.



## Install



## Peer Dependencies
```
react prop-types styled-components jquery datatables.net
```



## Motivation

The DataTables library is one of the most (if not the most) complete table librarys out there. It's api is incredibly flexible and it pretty much supports any table format you can think of.

There is just one problem though - it uses jquery. This makes it a little challenging to get working in a React application. 

This package aims to solve the issues associated with configuring DataTables to work with React.

It also introduces some extra features such as:
1) FlexBox layout
2) Auto vertical sizing
3) ajax fetch replacement
